# Install alembic
pip install alembic

# Create the alembic configuration file
Go to DWH directory
alembic init alembic

# Create a version file to define the migration
alembic revision -m "create DBES table"
then modify the migration file to add the table definition

# Run the migration
alembic upgrade head

# Using the rollback command
alembic downgrade -1

# To visualize the current revision
alembic current

# History of migrations
alembic history

# PB when to revisions have the same downgrade version (due to git branches conflicts after a merge)
alembic merge -m "merge <head1 detected> and <head2 detected>" <head1 detected> <head2 detected>
Note: we detect the that there is conflit by running alembic history to see if there is two revisions that have the same downgrade version
